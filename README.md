# The_Chase_Game_Project

Overview‬
‭ Welcome to the chase game app. This app is inspired by a popular TV show “The Chase”‬
‭ The app functions around the head to head version of the game where a “Player” competes‬
‭ against the “Chaser” or the app and moves down the ladder before getting caught by the‬
‭ chaser in order to win. Apparently, the goal of the player is to outsmart the chaser.‬

‭How to play the game‬
‭ 1.‬‭ Start the game‬
 Firstly, the player is introduced to the gameplay where the game asks the player to‬
‭ enter there name is the provided textfield‬
‬‭ The game then presents two options to the player either to start the game or to view‬
‭ the high scores before starting the game.‬

‭ 2.‬‭ Select the amount to play for‬
‭ The game then prompts the player to select the amount the player wants to play for‬
‬‭ Lower amount(£1000):‬‭ The player starts at position 4 in the ladder‬
‬‭ Standard amount(£7000)‬‭ : The player starts at the position 5 in the ladder‬
‬‭ Higher amount(£30000)‬‭ : The player starts at the position 6 in the ladder‬

‭ 3.‬‭ Head to Head round‬
‬‭ The game presents a question to the player with three possible answers‬
‬‭ The player needs to click one out of the three options‬
‬‭ The player’s response is highlighted by an orange colour‬
‬‭ The chaser’s response is highlighted by a yellow colour‬
‬‭ The correct response is highlighted after a delay of few seconds in green colour‬
‬‭ The position of both the chaser and the player gets updated in the ladder according‬
‭ to their responses.‬
‬‭ If the player has completed all the steps then the amount of money that was offered‬
‭ and this money is added to their running total and they may play again‬
‬‭ If the player is caught by the chaser then the game is over and no money is awarded‬
‭ for this round.‬
‬‭ The player’s total money made in the rounds just played, represents their final score‬

‭ 4.‬‭ Game results‬
‬‭ After the termination of the game the results are displayed on the next screen‬
‭ whether the chaser won or the player‬
‬‭ The player can tap the Play again button in order to play the game repeatedly unless‬

‭ the high score table on the next screen which displays the high score and also the‬
‭ player can restart the game if they want to play the game again from the starting.‬
